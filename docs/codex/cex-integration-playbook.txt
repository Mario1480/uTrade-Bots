ROLE: You are Codex working in this repository. Implement a new CEX adapter that conforms to the existing architecture (exchange interface, runner, api, web). Do not invent new patterns; follow existing code style.

GOAL:
Add a new CEX integration with minimal disruption. The adapter must support:
- public: getMid / getOrderbook (optional) / symbol meta (tickSize, stepSize, minQty, minNotional)
- private: getBalances, getOpenOrders, placeOrder (limit + market if supported), cancelOrder, cancelAll
- fills/trades: getMyTrades for fill-based volume counter
- clientOrderId preservation (critical for mm-/vol- prefixes)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Keep existing interfaces stable. If interface must be extended, implement for all existing exchanges.
- All “public” endpoints MUST NOT send API key headers (avoid 403 like Bitmart X-BM-KEY forbidden).
- Private endpoints must be properly authenticated (SIGNED if required).
- Use clientOrderId prefixes:
  - Market Making orders: "mm-<...>"
  - Volume orders: "vol<timestamp>" (note: no hyphen, must match /^vol(\d+)/)
- Precision normalization must be applied before submitting orders:
  - normalizePrice(price, tickSize)
  - normalizeQty(qty, stepSize, minQty)
  - enforce minNotional (price*qty)
- Implement rate-limit/backoff in the adapter (simple retry on 429/5xx).
- Never log secrets.

DELIVERABLES:
1) New adapter files:
   - packages/exchange/src/<cex>/<cex>.client.ts
   - packages/exchange/src/<cex>/index.ts (exports)
2) Register adapter in factory/registry:
   - packages/exchange/src/index.ts (or wherever exchange registry exists)
3) API:
   - /exchanges/<cex>/symbols (public symbols list for bot creation)
   - verify endpoint should work if present (optional)
4) Runner:
   - must be able to create Exchange instance for the new cex
   - getMyTrades must work (used by fill counter)
5) Tests / smoke checks:
   - minimal unit test for signing (if possible)
   - local smoke: create bot, start runner, see runtime mid/balances/openOrders

STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

A) Discover existing interfaces
- Locate exchange interface types in packages/exchange (ExchangePublic/ExchangePrivate).
- Identify required methods (balances, open orders, place/cancel, trades).
- Identify normalization helpers and reuse them.

B) Implement REST client core
- Create <cex>.client.ts with:
  - baseUrl
  - request(method, path, body, authMode)
  - auth modes: NONE (public), KEYED (rare), SIGNED (typical)
  - HMAC signing according to official docs (timestamp, recvWindow if required)
- Add robust error parsing; throw useful errors including HTTP status + exchange error codes.

C) Implement symbol meta
- Implement getSymbolMeta(symbol) and listSymbols():
  - tickSize, stepSize, minQty, minNotional, pricePrecision/qtyPrecision
- Ensure this call is PUBLIC (no auth headers).

D) Implement balances and open orders
- getBalances(): return { freeUsdt, freeBase } (or map multiple assets)
- getOpenOrders(symbol): must return clientOrderId and side/price/qty.

E) Implement order placement/cancel
- placeOrder:
  - supports LIMIT post-only for MM and Volume
  - supports MARKET only if used and supported
  - returns { orderId, clientOrderId }
- cancelOrder(orderId or clientOrderId): prefer orderId
- cancelAll(symbol): cancel all open orders on that symbol

F) Implement getMyTrades (fills)
- Must return tradeId, orderId, clientOrderId if available, price, qty, notional, timestamp (ms).
- Prefer time-based pagination (startTime/endTime) if available.

G) Wire into registry + API symbols endpoint
- Add to exchange factory, ensure config loader supports new CEX keys in DB/env.
- Add /exchanges/<cex>/symbols route returning list of symbol strings + base/quote.

H) Runner/Strategy integration checks
- Ensure the new exchange returns mid price for runtime.
- Ensure clientOrderId is preserved.
- Ensure precision normalization works (no order rejects due to step size).

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS:
1) Create bot in UI with exchange=<cex>, symbol=<pair>
2) Start runner
3) Runtime shows mid/bid/ask and balances
4) MM places mm- orders, openOrdersMm increments
5) Volume places vol... orders, openOrdersVol increments
6) Fill counter increases only on real trades (getMyTrades works)
7) No secrets in logs
